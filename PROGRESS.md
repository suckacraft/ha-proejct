# Progress Log

## 2026-06-08 — Stage 0: Monorepo Scaffolding

**Status:** Complete

**Decisions:**
- npm workspaces over Yarn/pnpm (npm available, keeps tooling simple)
- Exact pinned versions for all deps (reproducible builds)
- Placeholder source files export empty objects so imports work immediately
- Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite 8 + React 19 (latest stable stack)

**What was done:**
- Initialised git repo and root workspace config
- Created ha-core, client-app, and operator-app package skeletons
- Set up Docker Compose with three services
- Added CLAUDE.md with project rules
